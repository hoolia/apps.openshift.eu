# GRN.CLOUD application marketplace

Helm charts that tenants of the GRN.CLOUD OpenShift platform install into their own
projects.

    helm repo add grncloud https://apps.openshift.eu
    helm search repo grncloud

## What a chart may assume

The charts target the GRN.CLOUD platform. They rely on what the platform provides:
OpenShift Routes and builds, cert-manager, External Secrets, the MariaDB and
CloudNativePG operators, and object storage through ObjectBucketClaim. They are not
portable to an arbitrary Kubernetes cluster.

## Rules for a chart

- It installs into the release namespace and creates no Namespace and no cluster-scoped
  object.
- It ships no operator, no CRD and no SecurityContextConstraints binding.
- Every value has a default; a chart installs with no values given.
- `secrets.type` selects `kubernetes` (default) or `externalSecret`. With `kubernetes`,
  a machine-to-machine secret left empty is generated once and kept on upgrade.
- `README.md` has the sections Purpose, Install and Delivery instructions.
- `ci/check.sh` passes.

A chart is released when the `version` in its `Chart.yaml` changes on `main`.
